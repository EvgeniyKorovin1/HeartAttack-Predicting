# HeartAttack-Predicting
This project compared the effectiveness of models for predicting the occurrence of a heart attack in a patient. As part of the study, three machine learning models were selected, which were trained on the basis of medical data from a dataset available on the Kaggle platform ([“Heart Attack Analysis & Prediction Dataset”](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rashikrahmanpritom/heart-attack-analysis-prediction-dataset)).

## Using
The experiments were carried out using the cloud platform "Google Colaboratory". To reproduce the results, you need to run the code blocks in notebook sequentially. If the program is launched under different conditions, you may need to additionally install libraries: pandas, matplotlib, scikit-learn and others. The dataset used in the experiments is located in the folder Data - [HeartAttackAnalysis&PredictionDataset.csv](Data/HeartAttackAnalysis&PredictionDataset.csv).

## Documentation
